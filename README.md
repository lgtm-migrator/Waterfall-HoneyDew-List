This is a to-do list built with MySQL, Node, Javascript and CSS Grid. It is a full-stack app with add, post, and delete functionality. This app was styled responsively with CSS Grid.

# Getting Started
To get the app up and running, you'll need to clone or fork the repository by clicking the Clone button, then navigate to your machine terminal window. Change the working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made. Type ```git clone```,and paste the url from the Clone button click. It should resemble this: git clone github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY. Press enter. Your local clone will be created.
